# Wiki Updates

- The easiest way to update the wiki is to just use the edit button and fork it

## Local

- We [use poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage our python dependencies
- Simply follow the [instructions
  here](https://rgoswami.me/posts/poetry-direnv/) after cloning the repository

After that it is as simple as:

```bash
poetry shell # if you didn't set up direnv
mkdocs serve
```
